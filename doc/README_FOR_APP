This app is a simple demo of running a ruby daemon in the background to run recurring processor-intensive tasks without taxing the web app.
In this case, upload audio files and convert them to 128k mp3 files. Just upload an audio file, see app/models/audio.rb to see which formats are supported, or change if you want.

Setup:

Requires ffmpeg with the LAME mp3 encoder. If you're on a Mac, see this link:
http://stephenjungels.com/jungels.net/articles/ffmpeg-howto.html

Then, just run the usual rake tasks to create and migrate the databases.
The Daemon script is here: lib/audio_processor.rb.

Start and fork the daemon:
ruby ./script/runner ./lib/audio_processor.rb start
Stop it:
ruby ./script/runner ./lib/audio_processor.rb stop

Start and keep in foreground to see STDOUT:
ruby ./script/runner ./lib/audio_processor.rb run
Stop it:
ctrl c
